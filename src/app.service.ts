    ðŸš€ Workflow Orchestrator Challenge

    This is a trial project based on real production code.
    
    Current Endpoints:
    - GET  /           - This welcome message
    - GET  /health     - Health check
    - POST /execute-current - Current LangGraphService implementation
    - POST /execute-new     - Your new WorkflowOrchestrator (TODO)
    
    ðŸ“– See README.md for full challenge details
    
    The goal is to refactor the hard-coded LangGraphService into a 
    pluggable workflow orchestrator with dynamic routing.
